# Blackjack

## Everything in this project, including the below README.md, was generated by Claude Sonnet 4.

A fully-featured Blackjack game built with Python and Pygame, featuring betting, splitting, doubling down, and multiple hands.

## Features

- **Complete Blackjack Rules**: Hit, stand, double down, and split
- **Betting System**: Start with $1000 and place bets from $5 to $100
- **Multiple Hands**: Split up to 4 hands
- **Realistic Gameplay**: Dealer follows standard casino rules (hits on 16, stands on 17)
- **Visual Interface**: Card graphics and intuitive button controls
- **Game States**: Proper handling of betting, playing, and round completion phases

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pygame 2.0+

## Installation

1. Clone or download the game files
2. Install Pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Ensure you have a `cards/` directory with card images (PNG format)

## How to Play

1. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Place your bet**: Use the betting buttons ($5, $10, $25, $50, $100)

3. **Deal cards**: Click "Deal Cards" to start the round

4. **Play your hand(s)**:
   - **Hit**: Take another card
   - **Stand**: Keep your current total
   - **Double**: Double your bet and take exactly one more card
   - **Split**: Split matching cards into separate hands (requires additional bet)

5. **Win conditions**:
   - Beat the dealer without going over 21
   - Dealer busts (goes over 21)
   - Get Blackjack (21 with first two cards) for 3:2 payout

## Game Rules

- **Card Values**: Number cards = face value, Face cards = 10, Aces = 11 or 1
- **Blackjack**: 21 with first two cards (pays 3:2)
- **Dealer**: Hits on 16, stands on 17
- **Double Down**: Available on first two cards only
- **Split**: Available when first two cards have same value (max 4 hands)
- **Bust**: Going over 21 results in automatic loss

## Code Architecture

The game is organized into several modules for maintainability:

### `constants.py`
- Game configuration and settings
- Colors, dimensions, and gameplay constants

### `card.py`
- `Card`: Represents individual playing cards
- `Deck`: Manages the deck of cards with shuffling and dealing

### `hand.py`
- `Hand`: Manages a collection of cards with scoring and game state
- Handles blackjack logic, splitting, and doubling down

### `game.py`
- `BlackjackGame`: Core game logic and state management
- `GameState`: Enumeration of possible game states
- Handles betting, dealing, player actions, and dealer AI

### `ui.py`
- `Button`: Clickable UI buttons
- `GameUI`: Handles all rendering and visual feedback
- Manages different display states and layouts

### `main.py`
- `BlackjackApp`: Main application class with game loop
- Event handling and coordination between game logic and UI

## Customization

You can easily modify the game by changing values in `constants.py`:

- `STARTING_BANKROLL`: Starting money amount
- `DEALER_PLAY_DELAY`: Speed of dealer actions
- `MAX_SPLIT_HANDS`: Maximum number of split hands
- Colors and dimensions

## Card Images

The game expects card images in PNG format in a `cards/` directory. Image names should follow the pattern:
- `{value}_of_{suit}.png` for number cards and aces
- `{face}_of_{suit}2.png` for face cards

Example: `ace_of_hearts.png`, `king_of_spades2.png`

## Contributing

The modular design makes it easy to add new features:
- Add new game variants by extending the `BlackjackGame` class
- Customize the UI by modifying the `GameUI` class
- Add sound effects by extending the main game loop
- Implement save/load functionality by extending the game state
